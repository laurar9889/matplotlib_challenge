# matplotlib_challenge_

This challenge was one of the most difficult challenges I have had in the past 5 weeks. Since is the recap of Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, I had to spend countless hours reviewing the recorded classes, searching online, doing activities, and asking my peers for explanation to be able to make it on time. You will recognize that my code is very large and sometimes not efficient at all. I apologize for that, I still struggle with the use of loops and making them work properly. 

A total of 249 mice identified with SCC tumors were being put in an animal study by Pymaceuticals Inc. During 45 days, tumor development was observed and documented. Capomulin is the drug or interest.
